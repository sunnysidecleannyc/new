const faqData = [
  { q: 'How fast can you respond to an emergency?', a: 'We aim to respond within 2–4 hours for emergencies in Manhattan and within 4–6 hours for outer boroughs. Response time depends on the time of day, current team availability, and your location. For true emergencies (active flooding, biohazard), we prioritize same-day response.' },
  { q: 'How much does emergency cleaning cost?', a: 'Emergency cleaning typically ranges from $500 to $2,000+ depending on the type and severity. Water damage and fire cleanup cost more due to specialized equipment. We provide upfront estimates before work begins — no surprise bills. Many situations are covered by renter\'s or homeowner\'s insurance.' },
  { q: 'Do you work with insurance companies?', a: 'Yes. We provide detailed documentation of all work performed, including before/after photos, itemized invoices, and scope-of-work reports. This documentation is formatted to support your insurance claim. Many clients get full reimbursement for professional emergency cleaning.' },
  { q: 'Is my situation actually an emergency?', a: 'If there\'s active water flow, sewage, biohazard material, or fire/smoke damage — yes, that\'s an emergency requiring immediate professional response. Mold discovery, hoarding cleanup, and vandalism aftermath are urgent but can usually wait 24–48 hours for scheduling. When in doubt, call us and we\'ll help you assess.' },
  { q: 'What should I do while waiting for your team?', a: 'For water damage: stop the water source and move valuables. For fire/smoke: ventilate if safe. For all situations: document with photos, don\'t touch biohazard materials, and keep people and pets away from the affected area. See our detailed guides above for specific situations.' },
  { q: 'Can I clean emergency situations myself?', a: 'Small surface mold patches, minor spills, and general mess — yes. But for standing water, fire/smoke damage, sewage, biohazard, or any situation covering more than a small area — professional cleaning is strongly recommended. DIY attempts often make things worse or miss hidden damage that causes problems later.' },
  { q: 'Do you handle apartment emergencies or just houses?', a: 'We primarily serve NYC apartments — that\'s our specialty. We\'re experienced with the unique challenges of apartment emergencies: limited access, shared building systems, landlord coordination, building management communication, and the tight spaces common in NYC apartments.' },
  { q: 'What about my landlord\'s responsibility?', a: 'In NYC, landlords are responsible for maintaining habitable conditions. Water damage from building systems (not your negligence), mold from building ventilation issues, and sewage from building plumbing are landlord responsibilities. Document everything, notify them in writing, and know your rights under NYC Housing Maintenance Code.' },
  { q: 'Are you available on weekends and holidays?', a: 'Yes. Emergencies don\'t wait for business hours. We have team members available 7 days a week including holidays. Weekend and holiday rates may apply for non-urgent situations, but true emergencies are always prioritized regardless of when they happen.' },
  { q: 'What areas do you cover for emergency service?', a: 'We cover all five NYC boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. We also serve parts of Long Island and northern New Jersey for emergency situations. Response times are fastest in Manhattan and Brooklyn.' },
